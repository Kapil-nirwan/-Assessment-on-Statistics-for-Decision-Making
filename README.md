# Real Estate Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the final assessment for the Data Science course. The dataset used in this project contains real estate data from Australia, focusing on property prices, rooms, bathrooms, car parking, and more.

The project tests various hypotheses and answers questions using statistical methods, based on the real-world dataset provided.

## Dataset
The dataset contains property details such as suburb, sale date, price, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, and parking spots, among other features.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Hypothesis Testing - Property Prices in Altona
- **Hypothesis**: For the suburb Altona, it is postulated that a typical property sells for $800,000.
- **Task**: Test this hypothesis using the data. Check if the typical property price in Altona is significantly different from $800,000 at a significance level of 5%.

### 2. Seasonal Price Differences in 2016
- **Task**: Investigate whether there is a difference in property prices sold during the summer months vs. winter months for the year 2016. Summer is defined as April to September, and winter is defined as October to March.
- **Significance level**: 5%

### 3. Probability of No Car Parking in Abbotsford
- **Task**: For the suburb Abbotsford, calculate the probability that out of 10 properties sold, 3 will not have car parking. Use the column 'Car' in the dataset.
- **Note**: Round off your answer to 3 decimal places.

### 4. Probability of 3 Rooms in Abbotsford
- **Task**: Calculate the chances of finding a property with 3 rooms in Abbotsford. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.

### 5. Probability of 2 Bathrooms in Abbotsford
- **Task**: Calculate the chances of finding a property with 2 bathrooms in Abbotsford. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.
